Coconut, Coconut Sugar, Sea Salt","I was amazed to read that this bag of chips only contains THREE ingredients, and two of the ingredients are actually from the same source, assuming that ""Coconut Sugar"" comes 100% from Coconut.Do look at the picture of the chips in the picture. These chips are as small as you see in the picture, but they are delicious, but if you don't like coconut, don't get these chips.I got the 3.17 ounce bag, which is labeled to contain 3 servings. I can see that as a reasonable serving size, if you can control yourself. Unfortunately, I can see myself as being able to eat three servings at once, so I'm deliberately closing the resealable seal after each two bites, so I have to remind myself that I'm still eating.I saw other reviews that the bag only contains two child-size hands-ful, but I disagree. I'm not going to dump the contents into my hand, but it sure looks like more than two of my hands-fuls, and I have big hands to match my 6'5"" height.Do be aware that one serving contains 50% of the recommended daily value of Saturated Fat, so if you are paying attention to those numbers, you might want to avoid this snack, or have very small servings.If you enjoy coconut, and don't mind the high price, then I recommend these chips to you,but if you are counting all the %Daily Value numbers on everything you eat, then you probably want to avoid this snack.You decide.JohnP.S. It is a week later. I have not yet finished the bag. It is delicious, still, but I have to remind myself to drink plenty of fluids when I eat these coconut chips. Otherwise, I feel a lump in my stomach. It's sort of like trying to eat seven saltine crackers in your mouth at one time. You have to have fluid with this product.

(in a good way),"I stumbled across these looking for something else to have enough items on my Amazon Subscribe and Save order to get the 15% for the month.  I'm not even a coconut fan; usually the flavor is okay but the texture is too much for me.  But I figured I'd give them a try and pawn them off on my daughter (who loves all things coconut), so I added two bags to my order.  A few days after they arrived, I tore open the first bag thinking I'd get it over with...and could not stop eating them.  I finished off that whole family bag...all by myself...in a day. {insert guilt-ridden shame face here}  The 2nd bag didn't even outlast the week...and I made my daughter feel bad for taking a few without asking!  Needless to say, I changed my Subscribe & Save order to more bags, and to every month.In the meantime, while I wait for my June order, I've been all over town looking for them locally.  Sadly, I could only find one place that carried the ""plain"" in the small bags, and they are priced higher than these family-size bags!!!  I couldn't justify that, so found one other seller on Amazon that had one bag for $4.45 with a $25 order and 'justified' that order by getting a few books I've been wanting.  I'm serious - these are SOOOOOO good!  They don't get all mealy in your mouth like most coconut.

I purchased the original flavor first. I loved their sweet and crunchy strips of coconut so much that I decided to venture out and discover their variety pack which included Dang's original recipe, Caramel with Sea Salt, Bacon and Chile Lime. The product shipped within a day of ordering it. I received it packaged in such a delicate manner with bubble wrap,  as to not give the chips an opportunity to break into tiny pieces. I opened one of each bag to sample them. I first tried the one closest to the original flavor which is the Caramel Sea Salt. This flavor was so reminiscent of the original flavor that I hardly noticed a difference other than the occasional taste of a very light salting. They are not salted with chunks of sea salt. They are simply baked with the sea salt in the product. There is no residual salt in the bag that run of the mill sea salt chips or other chip like products may leave. In comparison to the original flavor, the Caramel Sea Salt is perfect to satisfy your sweet and salty needs all at once, while maintaining that signature Dang product crunch! Next I tried the Chile Lime. This flavor packs a punch. I was not expecting the kick it had. I mean my tongue was tingling like I had eaten a medium to hot chili for a second. It was then quickly followed by the tang of the lime. I am not one for hot food items but the combination adding the lime settles it down enough for me to take a few more bites of them. On the heat scale, I would rate this close to a hot nacho cheese or medium salsa. They maintain their coconut crunch through and through. The signature coconut flavor is slightly hidden under all the spice with just a hint of it at the very end. This is not a flavor to get if you are looking to taste the coconut in every bite. This flavor is one for giving you a little kick in the pants! Next, on to the bacon. I really cannot express enough that if you closed your eyes, you would think you  were eating a super crunchy piece of actual bacon! I was kind of taken aback  at how bacon tasting these little guys were. I personally did not care for this particular flavor but my husband and son ate two bags! I would recommend these as a healthier alternative to bacon flavored chips and actual bacon products. They have a light dusting of the bacon flavor but maintain the signature Dang product crunch. There is no hint of coconut at all in this flavor that I could detect. The last flavor is original. I have previously written a review on those and I will say yet again, that these are so crazy addictive that you cannot each just one. I find myself saying I'm only going to have a small handful and that has yet to happen. I never stop there! The original Dang's coconut chip is just genius. It is not overwhelmingly coconut based in any way. As I have said in another review, even if you are not a big fan of coconut flavored foods, give this a try! It is simply a hint of coconut with a sweet milky like flavor and then a crunch. I promise you, Dang's coconut strips will leave you saying ""Dang that is a great product!""",No,No,R2M55IOXAAPEJA,https://www.amazon.com/review/R2M55IOXAAPEJA/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0132GJO9Q,B0132GJO9Q,,,,,,,,,,5/16/19 22:36

Further, it's also lightly salted, which makes this like the coconut version of kettle corn.  And the calorie count isn't even that bad!  This makes an excellent snack - in fact, I prefer it on its own rather than as a topping to other foods.  My entire family is hooked now - I definitely recommend this product.",No,No,R3CLHWK3SHJ1EI,https://www.amazon.com/review/R3CLHWK3SHJ1EI/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009P2IUZQ,B07BN6WQQS,,,,,,,,,,5/16/19 22:36

I was looking for a bar that is low carb, no sugar/fruit and a few other specifications.1)  Almond Vanilla had an overpowering taste from the pea protein (not good) and not much taste from the vanilla or almonds in my opinion.  The good news is the texture seemed just right (not too dry, not too moist), but alas the flavor issue will keep me from purchasing this again.2)  Chocolate Sea Salt - first off it's very dry (I wish they had better texture like the almond vanilla that I tried first) and it's super salty (and I like salt).  The salt overpowers the chocolate flavor (really didn't taste much like chocolate to me) likely due to the pea protein hampering the chocolate taste and the salt trying to cover the pea protein taste up as well.  I still have half the bar and may try heating it up to see if it tastes better, but likely will not purchase again.I didn't try the lemon flavor (if the sale price was 3 for $6 I would have), but I'm pretty fussy with my lemon flavors and if it doesn't taste natural I likely wouldn't like it and I'm guessing the pea protein would be overwhelming with this bar too even with the green tea.

My comments would be more reserved, at four stars, because of the texture of these bars. My favorite flavor was chocolate, which surprised me, because I do not like the typical chocolate flavor in specialized dietary products. My least favorite was vanilla almond, until I got used to it. The textures are peculiar, with a bit of crunchy grittiness, but far better than the worst that diet bars can be. I appreciated that all three flavors had a mild natural sweetness that was balanced, not cloying. I keep several dang bars in my office for a quick ""emergency ration.""

Small bags, NOT resealable.","Unfortunately, these are delicious and healthy, as they are somewhat pricey and I don't like that there's such a small amount in each bag. Yes, this helps provide a bit of discipline, so you are more likely to just eat one serving (or, even more likely to eat the 1.4 servings it's packaged as); however, it is kind of wasteful and I wish there was a more eco-friendly way to package and distribute these, as they are one of my favorite snack foods. I'd purchased the larger bags in the past, with the resealable top, but when I ordered this one, I didn't realize these were the smaller version (sans the resealable feature).In addition to my preference for the taste, I also prefer the ingredients in this** flavor over the plain flavor (coconut sugar** vs sugar, and sea salt** vs salt). Interestingly, despite this flavor being ""caramel sea salt"", this flavor does not list caramel as an ingredient. Magical.I checked the prices on the subscribe and save for the single pack of the larger size vs the 12-pack of the smaller size, and, as of right now, with a 15% S&S discount on both, and a 10% coupon for the 12-pack, it's only a 1-cent per ounce difference. I'll stick with the larger, resealable bags for now.These are really delicious and quite healthy as a small snack. If you have trouble with willpower, you might have to be creative to help curb your cravings for handfuls of these tasty chips. Oh, and to describe them: they are larger shaved slices of coconut, just the right blend of crispyness and tenderness. If you like coconut at all, you'll probably really love these. I eat them straight, but you could use them as a garnish on a fancy dessert or a tasty topping for a fruit bowl or even ice cream. While I do wish the packaging was different, I hope they keep the edible part exactly as it is.And, heed my warning, these, and the dark chocolate dipped ones are quite possibly addictive.

But put one in your mouth and wow!  The crunch is like that of a freeze dried item, not a baked or regularly dehydrated coconut chip or chunk.  They are dreadfully addictive but if you just take a small handful the bag can last a few days.  You could also easily eat the entire bag in one sitting, as it's not a huge amount, maybe about a cup or cup and a half with all the little pieces.  Probably great on salad and in yogurt, but I didn't want to adulterate them with other food.My only wish is that they made an unsweetened or even less sweet version, as they are pretty sweet and I don't think coconut really needs that much sweetening to be yummy, especially with the texture these have.

These crunchy little chips are sweet, without being cloyingly sweet, and have a nice flavor. To me, they almost seem a little bit carmel or toffee flavored, which is probably the result of the toasting process bringing the natural sugars to the forefront.Of course, I also had to purchase the caramel version, but they haven't arrived yet.

So, I sadly accepted the idea of never eating tasty coconut chips again. Yesterday I found these at a local store that I frequent, which has an ever changing stock of interesting food and drink items. The packaging and name caught my eye immediately and I bought them. We had some more shopping to do and I kind of forgot about my sweet, sweet coconut chips until this morning when I saw them on the counter. I decided to open themFirst of all they smell heavenly. Think of the most wonderful toasted coconut smell accented with a bit of extra sweetness and you have a good idea. They're also very small, which you can see from the picture on the front of the (beautifully designed) package. ""Coconut chips"" makes me think of a size like potato chips or banana chips and these are more like coconut strips. This also makes them a little hard to snack on right out of the bag because they're kind of skinny and if you grab a bunch you then need to put that bunch into your mouth without dropping any of the nutty goodness on the floor or something. You'll occasionally get a nice cluster of chips stuck together. For maximum snackability I recommend pouring some into your palm and eating them out of there because the size of the bag may be an issue for people with larger hands. You could also just pour them straight into your mouth. That's also a good idea.I bought some vanilla almond milk on my shopping trip post coconut chip purchase, and while I was snacking I immediately regretted making my coconut chocolate museli the other day because that would have been awesome with the almond milk and some of these tasty little coconut chips on top. They are a great size for topping stuff.My one gripe is that the bag isn't resealable but if you have some masking tape handy that's really just a minor inconvenience. I've never had coconut chips sitting around in an open package for more than a day because they're just that good, so I have no idea if they get stale or something but resealable bags would be a nice improvement.I should mention that I paid 80 cents for one snack size packet of chips. I can't find the exact price of one single bag in a normal retail setting but another reviewer said that they are above a dollar. I'd gladly pay full price for one of these but I was lucky enough to find them at my local store for cheaper.",No,No,R19BI11EF4HOGY,https://www.amazon.com/review/R19BI11EF4HOGY/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009P2IUY2,B07BN6WQQS,,,,,,,,,,5/16/19 22:36

I definitely taste the coconut in them, and they're sweet, as well. They're crisper than most forms of flaked coconut I've purchased in the past, and they work better as a snack (as opposed to a baking ingredient or oatmeal add-in).They do have added sugar, which I'm not thrilled with, but I guess that's what gives them the sweet taste (and it's sweet in a good way, not overpowering). Being coconut, they're high in fat, especially saturated fat. If you eat a whole 1.43 ounce package, you get 70% of your saturated fat for the day. (Technically, this is equivalent to two servings, though.) It's definitely easy to eat the whole package, so watch out for that if you're counting calories.These are vegan, non-GMO, and gluten free. There's no allergen information listed on the package, though.Anyway, like I said, these taste pretty good. Since they're just coconut with a little sugar and salt, it would be hard to change them in any way to reduce the fat content!

You get 1.4 servings per 1.43 oz bag. That may not sund like much, but, it is actually quite a bit per serving. There is no trans fat and only 165 calories per serving.

I remembered that these Coconut Chips tasted surprisingly good--not that they're irresistible, especially to someone who's never cared much for ""fresh and raw"" coconut meat (or juice)--but slicing them thin and toasting them overcame any previous aversion to coconut.But this time I checked the ingredients.  Let's be honest.  Most consumers will more than likely see this small, 1.4 oz bag as a single serving.  A single oz. of this product contains a full 10 grams of fat--not ""good"" fat but saturated fat which, according to a best-selling book like Caldwell Esselstyn's ""Prevent Heart Disease,"" is the primary culprit in this national epidemic.  The most effective way of preventing heart disease (along with the course of statin drugs and even surgery) is, according to Dr. Esselstyn, to eliminate saturated fat altogether.If you're a male over 60 with any history of heart disease in your family, you should know that the pictured bag contains 70% of the official ""minimal daily requirement"" of saturated fat.  I usually balk at anything over 5%.  Your tolerance may be far greater than mine and the reward may outweigh the risk.  On the other hand, if you've already had an omelet for breakfast followed by a Big Mac for lunch and a pizza for dinner, these chips will look  and taste just as good at a later date.",No,No,R1IVFCTV57MYGM,https://www.amazon.com/review/R1IVFCTV57MYGM/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VH6BLM2,B00VH6BLM2,,,,,,,,,,5/16/19 22:30

I don't like their taste, their texture or the way they seem to judge me when they look at me.So, 'Why?' you may ask would such a person buy a treat based on a thing that he so despises? Because I was bored and I had extra amazon bucks laying around - stop judging me.Ok, seriously, I recall reading about them and one of the commenters mentioned that they really did not taste much at all like coconuts. I figured it was worth a try and I ordered a couple of bags to try out. If I hated them, I have at least two children who will eat anything so I knew it would not go to waste.They arrived and I stashed them away for when I was feeling more culinarily brave and forgot about them for a bit. Ultimately I gave in when all I had left in the house was canned tuna that was 9 months past its eat by date.To put it mildly, I was stunned. This stuff was awesome! Despite the fact that it is absolutely tasty and delicious, it also left me satisfied kind of quickly. I have no way to really explain this. Given how much I liked them, I would have figured I would plow through them and finish them off in one go. But that did not happen.And they go great with tuna.UPDATE: So I have gone through these finally. It's odd. They are good, there is no doubt about that. But they are not the kind of thing where you sit down and finish off a whole bag in one sitting. I just have a little bit now and then and I just feel satisfied. As good as these things taste, you would think that scarfing them down would be normal.
